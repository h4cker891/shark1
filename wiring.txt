alright solder goblin, lock in. imma walk you through this pin by pin so even with your shaky hands ts will still work fr.
I’m assuming:
ESP32 dev board
common GND
LiPo → USB charger → 5V/3.3V rail
you know which end of a soldering iron is hot (barely)
0️⃣ POWER (DO THIS FIRST OR NOTHING WORKS, GENIUS)
battery + charger
LiPo + → charger B+
LiPo − → charger B−
charger to ESP32
charger OUT+ / 5V → rocker switch
other side of rocker switch → ESP32 5V / VIN
charger OUT− / GND → ESP32 GND
👉 rocker switch just cuts power. simple. don’t overengineer ts.
1️⃣ COMMON GROUND (IMPORTANT OR YOU’LL CRY)
Pick ONE GND pin on the ESP32.
From that GND:
button ground
LED ground
transistor emitter
IR LED ground
ALL connect here.
Yes. ALL. Ground is communal property.
2️⃣ BUTTONS (STOP MIXING THEM UP)
top button = MODE
one leg → ESP32 GPIO 32
other leg → GND
bottom button = ACTIVATE
one leg → ESP32 GPIO 33
other leg → GND
NO resistors needed.
We’re using INPUT_PULLUP because we’re not idiots.
3️⃣ LEDs (THIS IS WHERE YOU BURN THEM IF YOU’RE DUMB)
Each LED needs its own resistor. No sharing like broke roommates.
LED 1 (Mode 0)
ESP32 GPIO 25
→ 220–330Ω resistor
→ LED anode (long leg)
LED cathode (short leg) → GND
LED 2 (Mode 1)
GPIO 26
→ resistor
→ LED
→ GND
LED 3 (Mode 2)
GPIO 27
→ resistor
→ LED
→ GND
LED 4 (Mode 3)
GPIO 14
→ resistor
→ LED
→ GND
If an LED doesn’t light:
flip it
don’t panic
you soldered it backwards, clown 🤡
4️⃣ IR TRANSMITTER (YES YOU NEED THE TRANSISTOR)
transistor (NPN, like 2N2222)
Facing flat side toward you:
LEFT   = Collector
MIDDLE = Base
RIGHT  = Emitter
wiring
GPIO 4 → 1kΩ resistor → Base
Emitter → GND
Collector → IR LED cathode
IR LED
IR LED anode → 5V through 100–220Ω resistor
IR LED cathode → collector (from above)
This lets the ESP32 switch the IR LED without nuking itself. good job not skipping this.
5️⃣ FINAL PIN MAP (READ THIS LIKE THE BIBLE)
GPIO 32 → MODE BUTTON
GPIO 33 → ACTIVATE BUTTON

GPIO 25 → LED 1 → resistor → GND
GPIO 26 → LED 2 → resistor → GND
GPIO 27 → LED 3 → resistor → GND
GPIO 14 → LED 4 → resistor → GND

GPIO 4  → 1kΩ → transistor base
Emitter → GND
Collector → IR LED → resistor → 5V

ALL GNDs → SAME GND
6️⃣ BEFORE YOU POWER IT (DO NOT SKIP OR RIP ESP32)
continuity check GND to GND ✅
no shorts between 5V and GND ❌
LEDs not backwards (lol)
battery plugged into charger, NOT directly into ESP32
if you want, next I can:
draw you an ASCII wiring diagram
convert this to a perfboard layout
or help you not melt the ESP32 like a dumbass
say the word, shark engineer 🦈😤
