WHERE YOU RUN THE CODE (ONE OPTION, DON’T GET CREATIVE)
You run ALL of it in Arduino IDE.
Not VS Code. Not Python. Not Notes app 💀
step 1: download arduino ide
Go to:
👉 arduino.cc → Software → Arduino IDE
download for macOS
open the .dmg
drag Arduino into Applications
open it (yes, allow it, Apple isn’t gonna arrest you)
🔌 CONNECT THE ESP32 (OBVIOUS BUT APPARENTLY NEEDED)
plug ESP32 into your Mac with USB cable
if it’s charge-only and not data, nothing will work → skill issue
🧠 SET UP ARDUINO FOR ESP32 (IMPORTANT, DON’T SKIP)
step 2: add ESP32 board support
In Arduino IDE:
Arduino IDE → Settings
In “Additional Boards Manager URLs”, paste this:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
click OK
step 3: install esp32 boards
go to Tools → Board → Boards Manager
search esp32
install “esp32 by Espressif Systems”
wait (yes, patience, i know it hurts)
📦 INSTALL LIBRARIES (OR IT WILL FAIL)
step 4: install required libraries
Go to Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries
Install:
IRremoteESP8266 (by crankyoldgit)
ESP32 BLE Arduino
If you don’t do this and hit compile → red errors → crying → your fault.
⚙️ SELECT THE RIGHT BOARD + PORT (THIS IS WHERE MOST PEOPLE FUMBLE)
step 5: board
Tools → Board → ESP32 Arduino
select ESP32 Dev Module
(if you know your exact board, good for you, but this one works)
step 6: port
Tools → Port
select the port that says something like:
/dev/cu.usbserial
/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART
If there’s only one option, congrats, that’s it.
🧾 PUT THE CODE IN (YES, ALL OF IT)
step 7: paste code
open Arduino IDE
delete everything in the editor
paste the ENTIRE code I gave you
don’t edit random stuff unless you enjoy pain
⬆️ UPLOAD (THE MAGIC BUTTON)
step 8: upload
click → Upload (top left)
wait
If it says:
“Connecting…” → good
“Done uploading” → W
red wall of text → you messed up earlier
⚠️ if upload gets stuck
Hold the BOOT button on ESP32
→ keep holding
→ click upload
→ release when it starts uploading
yes it’s annoying. yes it’s normal.
✅ HOW TO KNOW IT WORKED
ESP32 resets
LED 1 turns on
buttons respond
TVs nearby start acting funny
iphones get popups
you smile like a villain 😈
❌ COMMON “I MESSED UP” CHECKLIST
wrong board selected
wrong port
missing library
USB cable is trash
ESP32 needs BOOT button
